## NOTES

- Next.js caches the pages aggressvelty, to make page to page navigation faster and smoother. It even caches more aggressively in production.

- Next.js requires that error pages are rendered as client components. This is because next.js wants to ensure that the error is handled not only on the server, but also on the client.
